## Welcome to the dev branch.

This is the branch that you can commit. 'master' branch will be the stable version and 'dev' branch will be used for open commits.

## 

Futu is an extended customized function database, and Rimo is a custom shell that can be used in various situations.

You can use futurimo by copying the lib file to the work directory and typing "import futuraLib102 as futura"
Note: Futurimo is based on Python 3.8.

# Tutorial

You can start by implementing the libraries into the code.

```
import futura

futu = futura.Futu
rimo = futura.Rimo
```

This will make you faster while coding.

## Hello World!
